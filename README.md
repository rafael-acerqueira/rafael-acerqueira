### Hi there 👋

My name is Rafael Aquino. I've been working as Backend Developer with Ruby on Rails since 2014, and I worked with ReactJS in some freelance projects. Actually I work as a Backend Developer at Rockstar Coders

In my free time, I like to play League of Legends, watch soccer (⚽️), watch movies (🎞️), series (📺), and read books (📚).

Would you like to find me? 📫
